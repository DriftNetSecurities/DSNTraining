## About
This site is dedicate to the growth of knowledge of our team members here at Drift Net Securities.

### Getting Started
#### 5 Steps to getting started on a DSN Pathway Program.
1. Look around the DNS Site, and pick a Pathway
2. Once you pick a Pathway contact your manager for approval, this will start getting your seat for Coursera.
3. 'M' = Month, so for example you want to search for "sales", you will get a list of M#. Pick the appropriate M# for the month that you are on. Alternatively you can go to the home tab, and go to Tag cloud and pick the appropriate pathway.
4. Begin taking classes, add to the discussion each month if you have questions or interesting facts.
5. Have fun!
