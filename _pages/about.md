## About
This site is dedicate to the growth of knowledge of our team members here at Drift Net Securities.

### Getting Started
#### 5 Steps to getting started on a DNS Pathway Program.
1. Look around the DNS Site, and pick a Pathway and [subscribe](https://github.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=652172eb74f93abc95ec780c5&id=2e9b6b6002).
2. Once you pick a Pathway contact your manager for approval, this will start getting your seat for [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
3. 'M' = Month, so for example you want to search for "sales", you will get a list of M#. Pick the appropriate M# for the month that you are on. Alternatively you can go to the home tab, and go to Tag cloud and pick the appropriate pathway.
4. Let's make sure we can help you achieve success. By adding to the experience and enabling a coach. In order to do this please make a copy of the following [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qbdtJK_MuhqWm70xnq_mM9J7N2wu325q?usp=sharing), you will only be able to do this via your company email. Make sure to add your course completion certificates, projects and other course relate items in that drive. After you have copied the Google Drive, please share it with [Brigitte Coles](brigittec@driftnet.net). 
5. Have fun!
