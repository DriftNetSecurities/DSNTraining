## Pathways in Engineering
### Overview
Engineering Pathway is a hard but rewarding pathway here at Drift Net Securities. We ask each candidate to identify ways to improve their world and to build marketable digital solutions using KW Pods as the inspiration. Candidates will create an original app, product, or methodology that addresses a  community's need. Candidates will need to develop a plan for production, methodologies, and present in an Engineering Showcase for the chance to put ideas into production, and move into engineering roles. This pathway is by far the most extraneous and can be challenging, but also has the potential to be not only rewarding but also a step forward for both Drift Net Securities and candidates.
